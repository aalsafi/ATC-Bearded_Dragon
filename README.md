Atomated Temperature Control (ATC) for Beaded Dragon in Bangladesh

Bearded dragons are cold-blooded animals who are unable to digest consumed food without proper heat.  When a bearded dragon is kept in a captitive environment, it is a must to ensure a temperature gradient (hot/basking end, cold end). During the day, temperature of the basking area should always remain between 38-42°C (101-107°F). Overnight, as the temperature decreases naturally, Bearded dragons can stay quite comfortably even after the temperature drops to 15°C (59°F)

In a tropical country like Bangladesh, overnight temperatures merely drop below 15°C. So to keep your pet Bearded dragon healthy, you just have to keep the daytime temperature of basking area within the range mentioned above. A heat source placed at one end of the enclosure is usually enough to keep the temperatures within the required range across the entire thermogradient. Numerous Heating machines for reptiles are available in the market but are super costly.

On the contrary, my arduino-based temperature control system is pretty cheap and easy to build.

Dissection:
1. Arduino UNO - 4$
2. MAX31855 Module + K Type thermocouple temp Sensor combo - 4$
3. 5V-1 channel relay interface board (AC250V/10A) - 1$
4. 100W Clear GLS Bulb - 1$
5. USB Power bank - 10$
6. Some wires - 1$

Total Cost - 20$ (parts are avaliable in aliexpress)

Before physical integration, the system is designed and simulated in Proteus. Below is a simplified version of the compononet sketch. The detailed .pdsprj file is also available on request if you're really into petting reptiles.
