Atomated Temperature Control for Beaded Dragon (ATC)
Bearded dragons are cold-blooded animals. When a bearded dragon is kept in a captitive environment, it is a must to ensure a temperature gradient. Without proper heat, they are unable to digest the food they consume. A heat source placed at one end of the enclosure is usually enough to keep the temperatures within the required range across the entire thermogradient.
