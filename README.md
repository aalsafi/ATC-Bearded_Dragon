Atomated Temperature Control for Beaded Dragon (ATC)
Bearded dragons are cold-blooded animals who are unable to digest consumed food without proper heat.  When a bearded dragon is kept in a captitive environment, it is a must to ensure a temperature gradient (hot/basking end, cold end). During the day, temperature of the basking area should always remain between 38 - 42°C (101 - 107°F). Overnight, as the temperature decreases naturally, Bearded dragons can stay quite comfortably even after the temperature drops to 15°C (59°F)

In a tropical country like Bangladesh, overnight temperatures merely drops below 15°C. So 

A heat source placed at one end of the enclosure is usually enough to keep the temperatures within the required range across the entire thermogradient.
